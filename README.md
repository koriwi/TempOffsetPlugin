# Temp Offset Plugin

This plugin allows you to offset the temperature of your printer by a fixed amount. This can be useful if you have a printer that consistently prints too hot or too cold and you share material profiles between printers.

This code is based on the ZOffset plugin by fieldOfView. It's my first one and basically just a hacky copy and paste job.
